MediaWiki Pages
===============

Put your wiki pages in wikitext format here. 
The file extension should be .wikitext

NOTE: Since ":" is not allowed in some filesystems, use "___" instead. It will be converted to a ":" on upload.

NOTE: It is also possible to use this for uploading/updating your Wiki CSS or JS Files!
