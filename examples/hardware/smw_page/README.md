## Description
In this directory .wikitext files can be stored. They will be uploaded to the wiki and overwrite any page that mobo have created before. 

Please note that some characters canâ€™t be used for filenames, so some string substitutions have to be made. 

* `___` will be substituted with `:` (namespaces)
* `---` will be substituted with `/` (subpages)
