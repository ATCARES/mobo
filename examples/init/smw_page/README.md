MediaWiki Pages
===============

Put your wiki pages in wikitext format here.
The file extension should be .wikitext

AUTOMATIC REPLACEMENTS:
* ```___ -> :``` Since ":" is not allowed in some filesystems, use "___" instead. It will be converted to a ":" on upload.
* ```--- -> /```Subpages can be generated by using "---" as a placeholder for "/"
