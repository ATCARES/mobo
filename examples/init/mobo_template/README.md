## Description
This directory contains [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. They are used by mobo to generate the final wikitext pages. For more doc-umentation how they work, please refer to the Handlebars.js website.

The rendered output can be customized by editing those templates. They contain the rendered markup, some logic and strings that may want to be localized.
