Templates
=========

In this directory are predefined templates for the wikitext generation.
The Handlebars.js (http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine is used.
For documentation on templating look there.

Edit the templates if you want to:
 * Do localization
 * Change the rendered result of forms, templates, attributes etc. in general
