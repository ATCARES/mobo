# MediaWiki Concepts
> Read the latest version [online at GitHub](https://github.com/Fannon/mobo/blob/master/examples/init/smw_concept/README.md).

## Description
This directory works similar like /smw_page/. MediaWiki Concepts can be stored here without having to prepend `Concept___`. 

Please note that some characters canâ€™t be used for filenames, so some string substitutions have to be made. 

* `___` will be substituted with `:` (namespaces)
* `---` will be substituted with `/` (subpages)
