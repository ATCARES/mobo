* Read this file online at GitHub: [form/README.md](https://github.com/Fannon/mobo/blob/master/examples/init/smw_template/README.md)

## Description
Put your custom MediaWiki templates here. The file extension should be .wikitext
Custom templates will overwrite any generated template!

### Automatic String Replacements
* ```___ -> :``` Since ":" is not allowed in some filesystems, use "___" instead. It will be converted to a ":" on upload.
* ```--- -> /```Subpages can be generated by using "---" as a placeholder for "/"
